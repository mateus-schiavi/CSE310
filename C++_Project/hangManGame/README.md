# Overview

As a software engineer passionate about learning and exploring various programming languages, I developed this Hangman game to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency in C++. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in file handling, user input, and game logic in a structured programming language.

The software I wrote is a classic Hangman game where the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, tracks the number of wrong guesses, and offers an option to guess the entire word. If the player wins, they have the option to add a new word to the game's dictionary.

The purpose of this software is to create an interactive and fun game while showcasing my ability to implement C++ features such as file I/O, use of STL containers like `map` and `vector`, and basic game loop logic.

# Development Environment

For the development of this Hangman game, I used the following tools:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: Standard Template Library (STL), iostream, fstream, string, map, vector, ctime, cstdlib

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that were instrumental in this project:

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com) - For reference on C++ language features and STL
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) - For troubleshooting and community support

# Future Work

There are several enhancements and improvements I plan to make in future iterations of this project:

- **Item 1**: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game visually appealing.
- **Item 2**: Add more categories of words and let the player choose a category.
- **Item 3**: Enhance error handling and input validation to make the game more robust.
- **Item 4**: Implement a scoring system to track and display player performance.
- **Item 5**: Add multiplayer functionality for a more engaging experience.
