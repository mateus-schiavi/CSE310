# Overview

In an effort to deepen my understanding of the C++ language and its capabilities, I developed this Number Guessing Game. This project showcases fundamental C++ concepts such as input/output operations, conditional statements, loops, and random number generation.

The Number Guessing Game allows the player to choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) which determines the number of tries they have to guess a randomly generated secret number between 0 and 99. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it is too high or too low, and calculates the player's score based on the accuracy of their guesses.

This project aims to demonstrate my ability to implement game logic, handle user input, and manage program flow in C++.

# Development Environment

For the development of this Number Guessing Game, I used the following tools:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: iostream, cstdlib, ctime

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

There are several enhancements and improvements I plan to make in future iterations of this project:

- **Item 1**: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game visually appealing.
- **Item 2**: Add more difficulty levels and custom settings.
- **Item 3**: Enhance error handling and input validation to make the game more robust.
- **Item 4**: Implement a scoring leaderboard to track and display top scores.
- **Item 5**: Add sound effects and animations to enhance the gameplay experience.
